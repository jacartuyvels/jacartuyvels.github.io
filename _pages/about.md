I am a PhD researcher at the [CORE/LIDAM](https://uclouvain.be/fr/node/4474) institue in UCLouvain and I am part of the [research group](https://ap-rg.eu/) of Anthony Papavisiliou. I am financed by the [EPOC Belgium project](https://www.epocbelgium.be/en/about-epoc). My research interest is focused now on adequacy issues and how scarcity pricing can move these discussions forward. More broadly speaking, I am passionated by energy markets and I am always looking to use my modelling expertise and my operation research knowledge to investigate policy issues.
