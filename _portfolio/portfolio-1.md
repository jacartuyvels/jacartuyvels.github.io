The simulator models an idealized,fully coordinated operation of the Belgian system, with a focus on real-time operation.It consists of 4 embedded optimization problems that are solved in sequence throughoutthe day, in a rolling window fashion.  Each of these optimization problems is solved overvarying  scheduling  windows  and  in  a  sequencing  order  that  attempts  to  approximatethe  real-time  operation  of  the  system.   Particular  care  is  given  to  (i)  the  operationalconstraints  of  the  individually  modelled  generation  plants;  (ii)  the  revelation  of  real-time uncertainty and the scheduling of the system based on forecast information;  (iii)the effect of each decision-making stage on subsequent optimization problems.
